Stuff to be fixed in the power project:

** MPC algorithm **
Need to fix for the new method of calculating the control horizon (K), so that the algorithm functions
better in a distributed environment.

I am not sure if the variables in the load structure are being treated correctly (Pd / Pmax, Qd / Qmax, etc)

** XML data reading ** *** DONE -- mostly ***

each data type, and the PowerSystem class, needs the following pair of functions:

	read  ( data_string, format );
	write ( data_string, format );

where format includes an XML option. This will allow data exchange to occur more reliably.

format should include the following options:
	XML -- simple XML format for power system data
	MATPOWER -- series of data in MP order
	IEEE_CDF -- IEEE common data format
	PSSE -- PSS/E format (perhaps some day)

The PowerSystem class should have functions that read and write to/from files:

	read_file  ( filename, format );
	write_file ( filename, format );
	
These would merely call the string versions above, and read/write the strings from/to filename

*** add additioanl status variable to branch ***
branch should have a variable for both the from end status, and the to end status, which should be separate
