TODO issues for matrix project
-----------------------------------------

all of the types need a copy routine that inputs another element of the same type,
but starts at row, col (or index for the vectors):
	matrix_type::copy ( const matrix_type& A, unsigned row_begin, unsigned col_begin );
	vector_type::copy ( const vector_type& A, unsigned index_begin );

there should also be a version of clear that clears a subset of the matrix/vector
	matrix_type::clear ( unsigned begin_row, unsigned end_row,  unsigned begin_col, unsigned end_col );
	vector_type::clear ( unsigned begin_index, unsigned end_index );

I also need to produce a whole bunch of arithmetic routines for each type

there should be a solve routine from dense vector
dense_vector<T>::solve( sparse_matrix<T>& A, dense_vector<T>& b );

the production and destruction of triplet/csc/csr is not very stable.  I should probably come up with a new method.

Need to produce an installation routine
